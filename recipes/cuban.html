  <h1>Cuban Sandwich</h1>
  <img src="../images/cuban.jpg" alt="four mini cuban sandwiches" height="310" width="310">
    <p>This is one of the more famous sandwiches straight out of the island of Cuba. This recipe came from my
       uncle who used to work at a restaurant in Pinar del Rio, Cuba and now works at a Cuban cafeteria here in Miami. This sandwich 
       is best served with fried plantain chips and a cold mamey milkshake!

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 Sweet bread rolls</li>
      <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1/4 cup prepared mustard</li>
      <li>1 pound thinly sliced cooked ham</li>
      <li>1 pound thinly sliced fully cooked pork</li>
      <li>1 pound sliced Swiss cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup dill pickle slices</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Split the sandwich rolls in half, and spread mustad and mayonnaise liberally onto the cut sides.
      </li>
      <li>On each sandwich, place and equal amount of Swiss cheese, ham and pork in exactly that order. Place a few pickles onto each 
          one, and put the top of the roll onto the sandwich. Brush the tops with melted butter.
      </li>
      <li>Press each sandwich in a sandwich press heated to medium-high heat. If a sandwich press is not available, use a large skillet 
          over medium-high heat, and press the sandwiches down using a sturdy plate or skillet. Some indoor grills may be good for this also. 
          Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, keeping sandwiches pressed. If using a skillet, you may want to flip them once for even browning.
      </li>
      <li>Slice diagonally and serve hot.</li>

    </ol>
